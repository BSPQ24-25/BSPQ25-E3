<h1 id="student-loan-management-application-bspq25-e3">Student Loan
Management Application (BSPQ25-E3)</h1>
<h2 id="project-description">Project Description</h2>
<p>Student Loan Management is a platform for managing student loans that
allows students to apply for and manage loans to finance their
education, while lenders can offer their loan products and track them.
The system is designed to simplify the management of loans, ensuring
that students can access the financial resources they need, while
lenders can manage and oversee the status of their loans.</p>
<p>This project is implemented using Spring Boot, Java 17, JUnit 5 for
unit testing, Mockito for mocking, and JaCoCo for test coverage. The
application also utilizes JPA (Hibernate) for entity management and
database handling.</p>
<h2 id="key-features">Key Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>User Management: Users can register, log in, and update their
personal information.</p></li>
<li><p>Item Management: Users can add, update, delete, and query items
they want to lend or rent.</p></li>
<li><p>Loan Management: Loans can be requested, approved, and tracked by
both lenders and borrowers.</p></li>
<li><p>Status Notifications: Users receive status updates on loans,
items, and payments.</p></li>
<li><p>Unit Tests and Mocking: Unit tests are implemented to ensure code
quality, using Mockito for simulating external dependencies and JaCoCo
for measuring test coverage.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technologies-used">Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Java 17: The primary programming language used in the
project.</p></li>
<li><p>Spring Boot: Framework for backend application development with
automatic and minimal configuration.</p></li>
<li><p>Spring Data JPA: For persistence and database management using
Hibernate.</p></li>
<li><p>Unit 5: For running unit tests.</p></li>
<li><p>Mockito: For unit testing with mock objects simulating behavior
of external dependencies.</p></li>
<li><p>JaCoCo: For test coverage and code analysis.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installation-and-setup">Installation and Setup</h2>
<p>Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local
machine:</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Java 17 or higher.</p></li>
<li><p>Maven for managing dependencies and building the
project.</p></li>
<li><p>An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse is recommended for
working with the project.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="clone-the-repository">Clone the Repository</h4>
<p>Clone the repository to your local machine: - git clone
https://github.com/your-username/StudentLoanManagement.git</p>
<p>Navigate to the project folder: - cd StudentLoanManagement</p>
<h3 id="configure-the-database">Configure the Database</h3>
<p>The project uses H2 Database by default for data persistence. Make
sure to configure H2 or any other database you want to use in the
application.properties file of Spring Boot.</p>
<p>If you want to use H2 as an in-memory database, you can keep the
default configuration:</p>
<pre><code>spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=password
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect</code></pre>
<h3 id="install-dependencies">Install Dependencies</h3>
<p>Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:</p>
<pre><code>mvn install</code></pre>
<h3 id="running-the-project">Running the Project</h3>
<p>To run the project, simply use the following Maven command:</p>
<pre><code>mvn spring-boot:run</code></pre>
<p>This will start the server, and you can access the application at
http://localhost:8080.</p>
<h2 id="maven-commands">Maven Commands</h2>
<p>Here are some useful Maven commands for maintaining and managing the
project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean the Project: To remove the target/ directory and any compiled
files, run:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>mvn clean</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Compile the Project: To compile the source code, run:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>mvn compile</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Package the Project: To create a packaged .jar file:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>mvn package</code></pre>
<p>Install the Project: To install the project artifacts in the local
Maven repository:</p>
<pre><code>mvn install</code></pre>
<h3 id="running-tests">Running Tests</h3>
<h4 id="unit-tests">Unit Tests</h4>
<p>The project uses JUnit 5 for unit testing. To run all the tests, use
the following command:</p>
<pre><code>mvn test</code></pre>
<p>This will execute all unit tests and display the results in the
terminal.</p>
<h4 id="code-coverage-tests">Code Coverage Tests</h4>
<p>To generate a report of test coverage using JaCoCo, run the following
command:</p>
<pre><code>mvn verify</code></pre>
<p>This command generates a report in the target/site/jacoco/index.html
directory where you can view detailed coverage of your code.</p>
