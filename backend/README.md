# Student Loan Management Application (BSPQ25-E3)

This project is a student loan management application developed with **Spring Boot**. The application provides functionalities to manage loans, users, and associated services.

## Project Structure

The project structure follows the standard layout for a **Spring Boot** project organized in layers. Below is a breakdown of the directory structure:

```

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: Framework used to build the application.
- **Spring Security**: For security and authentication management.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For data persistence using Java Persistence API (JPA).
- **JUnit**: For unit and integration testing.
- **Maven**: Build tool for project management and dependency handling.

## Prerequisites

- **JDK 11 or later**
- **Maven** (for building and running the application)

## Running the Application

To run the application, you can use the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

This will start the Spring Boot application. Once the application is running, you can access it at:

- Default: `http://localhost:8080`

## Tests

The project includes both unit and integration tests. To run the tests, use the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn test
```

This will execute all unit and integration tests defined in the `src/test` directory.

## Configuration

### Security Configuration

This application uses Spring Security to manage authentication and authorization. The security configuration can be found in the `com.student_loan.config.SecurityConfig` class. The application is configured to use basic authentication for testing purposes.

### Database Configuration

The project uses an in-memory database (H2) by default for quick development and testing. The connection details and settings are configured in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file. You can modify these settings to connect to a real database (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) for production use.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter the following error during testing:

```
No bean named 'mvcHandlerMappingIntrospector' available: A Bean named mvcHandlerMappingIntrospector of type org.springframework.web.servlet.handler.HandlerMappingIntrospector is required to use MvcRequestMatcher.
```

This indicates that the Spring Security and Spring MVC configurations are not properly linked in the application context. Ensure that both Spring Security and Spring MVC are configured within the same application context, and that the necessary beans are properly instantiated.

## Folder Breakdown

### `src/main/java`

- **config**: Contains configuration classes (security, application settings, etc.).
- **controller**: REST controllers to handle HTTP requests.
- **dtos**: Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) used for communication between layers.
- **model**: Domain model classes (entities mapped to database tables).
- **repository**: Repositories to handle database operations using Spring Data JPA.
- **security**: Security configuration, including authentication, authorization, and security filter chains.
- **service**: Business logic and service classes.

### `src/test/java`

- **integration**: Tests that verify the interaction of different components (e.g., controllers, services, repositories).
- **performance**: Tests that measure the performance of certain services or methods.
- **unit**: Unit tests for individual components, such as controllers, services, and repositories.

### `target`

This folder contains the compiled classes and the packaged application after building with Maven.
